# AI Projects: Patient Readmission & Fake News Trend Prediction
AI Projects: Patient Readmission & Fake News Trend Prediction
This repository contains two AI-powered projects that address real-world problems in healthcare and media integrity:

🏥 1. Patient Readmission Prediction Model
Goal:
To predict whether a patient will be readmitted to the hospital within 30 days after discharge using an AI model, helping hospitals take proactive measures to reduce costs and improve care.

✅ Objectives
Identify patients at high risk of readmission.

Enable proactive care (follow-ups, home visits).

Reduce healthcare costs and penalties.

👨‍⚕️ Stakeholders
Hospital administrators

Doctors and nurses

Patients

📊 Data Used
Electronic Health Records (EHRs): Diagnoses, medications, vitals, visit history.

Demographics: Age, gender, insurance type.

Discharge Notes: Used with NLP for feature extraction.

⚙️ Model
Algorithm: Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)

Performance:

Precision: 0.538

Recall: 0.700

Interpretation: Good recall means the model catches most at-risk patients but needs better precision.

🔄 Workflow
Data cleaning, imputation, encoding, and scaling.

Train/Validation/Test split (70/15/15).

API deployment for EHR integration.

Ongoing monitoring and feedback loop.

⚠️ Ethical Considerations
Bias: Underrepresented patient groups may be misclassified.

Mitigation: Fair sampling and fairness-aware algorithms.

Privacy: Follows HIPAA compliance and uses encrypted data access.

📰 2. Fake News Trend Prediction Using AI
Goal:
To detect and predict trending fake news topics before they go viral using social media and fact-checking data.

✅ Objectives
Forecast misinformation topics likely to trend in the next 48–72 hours.

Detect regions or groups where fake news may spread rapidly.

Provide early alerts to fact-checkers and media platforms.

👥 Stakeholders
Social media platforms (e.g., Facebook, TikTok)

Fact-checking organizations (e.g., PesaCheck, Africa Check)

📊 Data Used
Social Media APIs: Posts, shares, engagement data.

Fact-Checking Databases: Verified claims and narratives.

⚙️ Model
Algorithm: Random Forest Classifier

Why: Handles noisy, imbalanced data and provides feature importance.

🔄 Workflow
Preprocess text (cleaning, normalization, topic modeling).

Train/Validation/Test split (70/15/15) using stratified sampling.

Evaluate with F1 Score and AUC-ROC for balanced performance.

Monitor concept drift (e.g., changes in misinformation patterns).

⚠️ Deployment Challenges
Scalability: Must process millions of posts in real-time.

Solution: Use cloud pipelines, message queues (Kafka), and real-time tools (Spark/Flink).

📦 Summary
Project	Focus	Model	Key Metrics	Challenge
Patient Readmission	Healthcare	XGBoost	Recall = 0.70	Fairness & Interpretability
Fake News Prediction	Media Integrity	Random Forest	F1 Score, AUC	Scalability & Drift

🔐 Ethics & Fairness
Both projects emphasize:

Bias mitigation in AI models.

Explainable decisions, especially in sensitive sectors.

Responsible data use and regulatory compliance.
